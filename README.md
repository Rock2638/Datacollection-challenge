### Datacollection-challenge
This is a web-scraping and data analysis challenge. 
It involves identifying HTML elements on a page, identifying their id and class attributes, and using this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.
This Challenge also involves strengthening the core data analytics areas: collecting data, organising and storing data, analysing data, and then visually communicating the results.
Two deliverables are submitted here:

 - Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

 - Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyse Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
